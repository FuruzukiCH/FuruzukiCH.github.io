No one can refute his contribution has brought Singapore to one of the richest countries in the world. His view on the world proves to be clear and to the point. Also, as his identity of English-speaking Chinese, his view tends to be more neutral than both the western and Chinese media.\nWhat does politics mean to me? #  Politics is the science of managing, reconciling, and system designing. While this is the work for politicians, politics intrinsicly influences every facets on the society.\nAs we can observe recently, the trade war between China and American, the Russo-Ukrainian war, and like, have profoundly changed the life of all mankind.\nKnowing politics helps us avoid the potential criese and survive from the upcoming turbulent world.\nContents #  China #  Chinese people need a strong center government to feel safe. This culture derives from the over two thousand year history on strong central government. Since Deng Xiaoping reopened China for economy development, China has grown at an unprecedented speed. While some potential troubles within Chinese society, China has become one of the greatest power in the world, in both economy and politics. Soon, US will not be able to compete with China in East Asia and South East Asia. China might not be able to project its power into Europe or elsewhere. It will also be harder for US to project its power to Asia because its too far.\nThough, China faces severe problem of shortage of domestic consumption, which comes from the extreme unbalanced distribution throughout the country. Another problem for China is the up-down government confines innovation. Everything depends on central policies. Distant villages in Sichuan will never imagine to compete with Shanghai.\nMy view\nChina truly has reached an unbelieveable level of development. China\u0026rsquo;s EV makers are taking over the traditional fossil vehicals. A comprehensive industry system and a huge domestic market allow China to compete with the world and overpass them gradually.\nThe demographic problem and the weakness of domestic consumption also pose a potential threat towards the long term development to the second largest economic entity. The bubble in real estate has become larger and larger. No one knows what will happen when the bubble bursts.\nI am relatively pessimistic about China\u0026rsquo;s future. The government\u0026rsquo;s brainwashing has raised the hostility towards other countries to an unprecedented level. China is more and more isolated in the world stage. It\u0026rsquo;s too early to show strength. I also don\u0026rsquo;t think the government has the ability to change the fundamental and profound problems rooted in the society. The risk of war is also a factor, adding the tension between China and US. International cooperation decreases as the sanction from US and the emergence of a more aggressive China.\n US #  US intrinsically has the culture influence as English has become the international language. The world will be easier to accept US value than Chinese. Another edge US has is its culture of encouraging monetizing. As a new technology comes out, you will never worry about money. Hundreds of venture captials will compete to invest on you. This culture will keep motivate innovation in US, making it the strongest country in the world.\nThis also leads to problems in social division and welfare. Because the capital and the government only cares about elites, lower class is deprecated, causing security problems.\nJapan #  Demographic Problem has become the largest problem for Japan. Its own citizens refuse to reproduce while they also reject immigrants. Japanese people like to stick to the rule/tradition, sometimes too much. Only young people can innovate and consume. With an older Japan, it will be less and less competent, making Japan strolling to mediocre. Though it might still have a rather comfortable living standard. But it might not last long.\nEurope #  Europe Union is a good but not practical idea. Its members have their own culture and history. There will not form real union. Now they have Euro but each member has its own bank. They should not have allowed so many countries entering EU. So now countries like Greece suffers from the dump from more competitive countries like Germany. As EU is a loose union, German will not be willing to help Greek with their economy crisis.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/posts/weekly-0001/","title":"Weekly #1 - Reflection and Outlook","section":"Blogs","content":"2022 is a crazy year. A turbulent first half comes along with a dramatic second half. Life is just crazy and unpredictable, but things have to go on.\n World in 2022 #  Elon Musk buys Twitter #  Elon Musk acquired Twitter with $440B, making Twitter his private property. Although he claimed this deal is for promoting Free speech, his reform does not seems to align with his promise. After his attempts, including laying off over 70% of the employees and blue verified, Musk has not put the company into the right trajectory. Right after the final of the world cup, Musk polled on Twitter, casting doubt on the future leadership of Twitter. Though he pledged he would abide by the results, the alternate still remains to be announced.\n\u0026ldquo;White paper\u0026rdquo; revolution \u0026amp; Jiang Zemin\u0026rsquo;s death #  After the deadly fire in Xinjiang, demonstration burst out in most of the major cities in China, critizing CCP\u0026rsquo;s zero-covid policy. Demostrantion in such scale has not been seen since 1989, posing great pressure on the CCP government. Especially, the demostration burst out right after Xi Jinping claiming his third term, breaking the former tradition. But in the end, we all know there will not be a revolution.\nA week after the fire accident in Xinjiang, CPP announced the death of the former president Jiang Zemin. The news released right amid covid anger, distracting people\u0026rsquo;s attention on the demonstraction.\nChina exits its \u0026ldquo;Zero Covid\u0026rdquo; policy #  Right after the \u0026ldquo;white paper\u0026rdquo; revolution, China start to lift its zero covid policy, marking the end of the three-year strict covid policy and travel restriction. We have to admit, the first two year of China\u0026rsquo;s covid policy was a success and reduced the toll into minimum, while the third year turns out to be a disaster. The end of the policy did not lead to the end of covid. Instead, it caused more problems. The sudden open-up led to the lack of ICU, medicine. China is not ready for the reopening. Concerns have risen about the humantarian problem of unprecedented toll of covid.\nRusso-Ukrainian War #  Russia and Ukraine started a long war since Februrary, with Putin announcing a \u0026ldquo;special military operation\u0026rdquo; in Ukraine. The war posed great threat to energy and territory safety to countries around the world. Russia was belived to end the war and take Ukraine promptly, while turning out trapped in the war, hard to see the end. The war definitely will profoundly change the world.\nMe in 2022 #  Dramatic career path #  As the proximity of the economic recesssion, tech companies start to cut their costs, laying off employees and freezing hiring. I still struggled to attain an internship position, but failed to get the return offer. When things seem to set, new hope comes up and gave me possibility to work abroad to start a new live.\n Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you\u0026rsquo;re going to get.\n Harness habits #  I was never a reader but recently found the pearls in books. Lee Kuan Yew\u0026rsquo;s One man\u0026rsquo;s view of the world really enlightened me to start observing the world. We common people seems to have nothing to do with the politcs, but it intrinsically determines our current life and future development. Economy and Politics deserves to focus on as long as we still live on the world.\n Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man.\n Output is as, if not more, important than input. So I build this blog website to write my observatiions on trival things to international breaking news.\nAtomic Habits provides a manual on how to deprecate bad habits and build new habits. Hope this will bring me a different 2023.\nClosing #  2022 has been a tough year for me. Being rejected, being defeated, being disappointed. But at least I am still young. The world remains to be explored.\n 2023: Be bold. Be disciplined.\n "},{"id":8,"href":"/posts/thoughts-0001/","title":"Thoughts #1 - Fact and Opinion","section":"Blogs","content":"Fact and Opinion are intrinsicly different but come to us alike. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to distinguish between Fact and Opinion. People tend to use a factual narrative to make their opinion more convincing. Fact is what we can likely rely on while opinion requires a second thinking. How to tell the difference of the two will be vital to make our thinking consistent and harness our own opinion and ideology.\nTBD after reading The News: a user\u0026rsquo;s manual\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/posts/weekly-0002/","title":"Weekly #2 - A Small Step Makes The Whole Different","section":"Blogs","content":"A step is trivial, but can also be grand. In the book Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about how small steps make habits. A step can be the beginning of a habit or an everyday routine. Trying to divide a hard task into atomic steps is the key to harness habits. This idea is also supported by human\u0026rsquo;s nature of preferring easier things, or things with less friction. Running 10km everyday could be hard, but running for 100m or just walk for a while is doubtlessly easy. These small steps enable us to switch from thinking to acting. Planning could be important, but acting is really about making progress and forming muscle memory.\nAs the new semester approching, unpredicted pressure comes up. Things has to move on. Now that I have the way out, no need to concern about it. During this holiday, I think I am gradually building up the habit of reading. Reading has never become so attracting to me. That actually makes sense because the book writers tend to put several months, if not years, into a book and under the revision of editors. There is larger probability that it is deeper and more intersting than short videos.\nThe world is just getting worse and worse. Autocratic oritental countries and turbulent western coutries. Tension between US and China is growing. Thanks to nuclear weapons, there will be little chance for large scale war, though the Russo-Ukrainie war has added enough uncertainty to the world.\nThree Bodies written by Liu Cixin, is very much THE science fiction of recent China. I have rarely know any books with such a grand while believeable background. It has been too long since I last look up the sky, wandering it there is any other civilization in the universe. The endless galaxy makes me feel so small. What if the existence of human being is just a coincidence. What if all we fight for, all we think about is just meaningless dust to higher-dimension civilization. We don\u0026rsquo;t really need to struggle about meaning. Living itself is the meaning, I would rather believe. As long as we live, we are still making a difference, whether it is trivial or not.\nThat leads to the thinking about individualism or collectivism. I personally vote for individualism. Without organization, people cannot muster their strengths to achieve higher. With too much centralized, we put the whole orgnization at risk. I don\u0026rsquo;t think we can really believe on the power of heroes, or at least cannot lean on it. Only a solid system can keep moving forward, a system with error-detecting programs. Sure, a great man will take a leap for the whole country, he might also destroy the country. If he does not, his successors might. We cannot rely on any individual, we need a well-designed system.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/docs/ece580/chapters/lec01_linear_regression/","title":"Lec01 Linear Regression","section":"ECE580 Introduction to Machine Learning","content":"Linear Regression #  Linear regression vs non-linear regression #  linear: straight line\nnon-linear: curved line\nMajor steps of linear regression #   select a model template generate a number of sampling points measure function (f) values at these sampling points create a set of linear equations to solve model coefficients solve overdetermined linear equations  1.
