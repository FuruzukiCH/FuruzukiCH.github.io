      <description>China reversed its zero covid policy #  By the end of an otherwise triumphant Communist Party Congress for Xi Jinping in October, it became harder for the government to prolong its zero covid policy.
The containment meansure has come at a high cost, cutting sharply into the nation&amp;rsquo;s exports and retail sales, draining local finances and driving parts of the population to a near-breaking point.
As late as mid-November, Xi was still wavering on whether and how to unwind a policy he had so closely associated himeself.</description>

      <title>Thoughts #1 - Fact and Opinion</title>

      <description>Fact and Opinion are intrinsicly different but come to us alike. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to distinguish between Fact and Opinion. People tend to use a factual narrative to make their opinion more convincing. Fact is what we can likely rely on while opinion requires a second thinking. How to tell the difference of the two will be vital to make our thinking consistent and harness our own opinion and ideology.

      <title>Weekly #2 - A Small Step Makes The Whole Different</title>

      <description>A step is trivial, but can also be grand. In the book Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about how small steps make habits. A step can be the beginning of a habit or an everyday routine. Trying to divide a hard task into atomic steps is the key to harness habits. This idea is also supported by human&amp;rsquo;s nature of preferring easier things, or things with less friction. Running 10km everyday could be hard, but running for 100m or just walk for a while is doubtlessly easy.</description>
