<p>A step is trivial, but can also be grand. In the book <em>Atomic Habits</em>, James Clear talks about how small steps make habits. A step can be the beginning of a habit or an everyday routine. Trying to divide a hard task into atomic steps is the key to harness habits. This idea is also supported by human&rsquo;s nature of preferring easier things, or things with less friction. Running 10km everyday could be hard, but running for 100m or just walk for a while is doubtlessly easy. These small steps enable us to switch from thinking to acting. Planning could be important, but acting is really about making progress and forming muscle memory.</p>
<p>As the new semester approching, unpredicted pressure comes up. Things has to move on. Now that I have the way out, no need to concern about it. During this holiday, I think I am gradually building up the habit of reading. Reading has never become so attracting to me. That actually makes sense because the book writers tend to put several months, if not years, into a book and under the revision of editors. There is larger probability that it is deeper and more intersting than short videos.</p>
<p>The world is just getting worse and worse. Autocratic oritental countries and turbulent western coutries. Tension between US and China is growing. Thanks to nuclear weapons, there will be little chance for large scale war, though the Russo-Ukrainie war has added enough uncertainty to the world.</p>
<p><em>Three Bodies</em> written by Liu Cixin, is very much THE science fiction of recent China. I have rarely know any books with such a grand while believeable background. It has been too long since I last look up the sky, wandering it there is any other civilization in the universe. The endless galaxy makes me feel so small. What if the existence of human being is just a coincidence. What if all we fight for, all we think about is just meaningless dust to higher-dimension civilization. We don&rsquo;t really need to struggle about meaning. Living itself is the meaning, I would rather believe. As long as we live, we are still making a difference, whether it is trivial or not.</p>
<p>That leads to the thinking about individualism or collectivism. I personally vote for individualism. Without organization, people cannot muster their strengths to achieve higher. With too much centralized, we put the whole orgnization at risk. I don&rsquo;t think we can really believe on the power of heroes, or at least cannot lean on it. Only a solid system can keep moving forward, a system with error-detecting programs. Sure, a great man will take a leap for the whole country, he might also destroy the country. If he does not, his successors might. We cannot rely on any individual, we need a well-designed system.</p>
