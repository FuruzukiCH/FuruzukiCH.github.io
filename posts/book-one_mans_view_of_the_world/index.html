  Abstract
  <a class="anchor" href="#abstract">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The former PM of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, is a controversial icon in the world politics. No one can refute his contribution has brought Singapore to one of the richest countries in the world. His view on the world proves to be clear and to the point. Also, as his identity of English-speaking Chinese, his view tends to be more neutral than both the western and Chinese media.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-politics-mean-to-me">
  What does politics mean to me?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-does-politics-mean-to-me">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Politics is the science of managing, reconciling, and system designing. While this is the work for politicians, politics intrinsicly influences every facets on the society.</p>
<p>As we can observe recently, the trade war between China and American, the Russo-Ukrainian war, and like, have profoundly changed the life of all mankind.</p>
<p>Knowing politics helps us avoid the potential criese and survive from the upcoming turbulent world.</p>

</h3>
<p>Chinese people need a strong center government to feel safe. This culture derives from the over two thousand year history on strong central government. Since Deng Xiaoping reopened China for economy development, China has grown at an unprecedented speed. While some potential troubles within Chinese society, China has become one of the greatest power in the world, in both economy and politics. Soon, US will not be able to compete with China in East Asia and South East Asia. China might not be able to project its power into Europe or elsewhere. It will also be harder for US to project its power to Asia because its too far.</p>
<p>Though, China faces severe problem of shortage of domestic consumption, which comes from the extreme unbalanced distribution throughout the country. Another problem for China is the up-down government confines innovation. Everything depends on central policies. Distant villages in Sichuan will never imagine to compete with Shanghai.</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <p><strong>My view</strong><br>
China truly has reached an unbelieveable level of development. China&rsquo;s EV makers are taking over the traditional fossil vehicals. A comprehensive industry system and a huge domestic market allow China to compete with the world and overpass them gradually.</p>
<p>The demographic problem and the weakness of domestic consumption also pose a potential threat towards the long term development to the second largest economic entity. The bubble in real estate has become larger and larger. No one knows what will happen when the bubble bursts.</p>
<p>I am relatively pessimistic about China&rsquo;s future. The government&rsquo;s brainwashing has raised the hostility towards other countries to an unprecedented level. China is more and more isolated in the world stage. It&rsquo;s too early to show strength. I also don&rsquo;t think the government has the ability to change the fundamental and profound problems rooted in the society. The risk of war is also a factor, adding the tension between China and US. International cooperation decreases as the sanction from US and the emergence of a more aggressive China.</p>

<h2 id="us">
  US
  <a class="anchor" href="#us">#</a>
</h2>
<p>US intrinsically has the culture influence as English has become the international language. The world will be easier to accept US value than Chinese. Another edge US has is its culture of encouraging monetizing. As a new technology comes out, you will never worry about money. Hundreds of venture captials will compete to invest on you. This culture will keep motivate innovation in US, making it the strongest country in the world.</p>
<p>This also leads to problems in social division and welfare. Because the capital and the government only cares about elites, lower class is deprecated, causing security problems.</p>
<h2 id="japan">
  Japan
  <a class="anchor" href="#japan">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Demographic Problem</strong> has become the largest problem for Japan. Its own citizens refuse to reproduce while they also reject immigrants. Japanese people like to stick to the rule/tradition, sometimes too much. Only young people can innovate and consume. With an older Japan, it will be less and less competent, making Japan strolling to mediocre. Though it might still have a rather comfortable living standard. But it might not last long.</p>
<h2 id="europe">
  Europe
  <a class="anchor" href="#europe">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Europe Union is a good but not practical idea. Its members have their own culture and history. There will not form real union. Now they have Euro but each member has its own bank. They should not have allowed so many countries entering EU. So now countries like Greece suffers from the dump from more competitive countries like Germany. As EU is a loose union, German will not be willing to help Greek with their economy crisis.</p>
